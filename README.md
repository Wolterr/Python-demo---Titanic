# Python-demo---Titanic
This repository contains a simple analysis of the Kaggle Titanic dataset. 
The goal is to provide a quick intro into python for some colleagues. 

This code is used in a seminar where we compare Matlab, R, Python, Knime and RapidMinder.

Repository contains
- iPython notebook : The initial code for this project
- Python code      : Export from the notebook. More useful in other python tools
- data directory   : directory containing the train and test data
- images           : PNG exports of the two visualisations in the notebook
